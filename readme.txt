1. run code Tree_Iterative_Method and it will save an excel
2. run code Tree_initialize_AD and save a pretrained netwok
3. run code Tree_Train_AD and train network, also it will save an excel
4. run code Tree_initialize_sig_q and save a pretrained netwok
5. run code Tree_Train_sig_q and train network, also it will save an excel
6. run code plot, which loads all excels and save a figure

Although the TensorFlow+Keras I'm using is very outdated,
I can hand it over to AI to convert it to PyTorch or JAX.
I've been heavily leveraging AI to write code, so don't be surprised if you encounter strange comments.

Solve one Cryptocurrency tree with two normal trees

1. run code Tree2_initialize_AD and save a pretrained netwok
2. run code Tree2_Train_AD and train network and save trained network
3. run code plot2, which loads network and save a figure
