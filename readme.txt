1. run code Tree_Iterative_Method and it will save an excel
2. run code Tree_initialize_AD and save a pretrained netwok
3. run code Tree_Train_AD and train network, also it will save an excel
4. run code Tree_initialize_sig_q and save a pretrained netwok
5. run code Tree_Train_sig_q and train network, also it will save an excel
6. run code plot, which loads all excels and save a figure

Although the TensorFlow+Keras I'm using is very outdated,
I can hand it over to AI to convert it to PyTorch or JAX.
I've been heavily leveraging AI to write code, so don't be surprised if you encounter strange comments.
